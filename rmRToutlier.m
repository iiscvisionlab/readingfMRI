% function RT = rmRToutlier(rt,rt_thresh, ncounts)
% This function removes outliers in Reaction time, If the frequency of
% Reaction time at given thershold is less than ncounts. Then those RTs are
% set to nan. 
% Input:
%       rt = Input raw reaction time
%       rt_thresh = Cut-off threshold of reaction time
%       ncounts = minimum number of occurrence of RT above the mentioned threshold
% Output:
%       RT = Denoised Reaction Time
